# Capacitors

Capacitors are used to store electrical charge.

They charge and release energy mush more quickly than battieries.

## Charging and discharging
Capacitors lose current, potential difference and charge exponentially.

IMPORTANT
---
When measuring the discharge with a DMM, the DMM must be in parallel as the internal resistance (which is high when measuring voltage) will have a significant effect on the rate of discharge.

The capacitor time constant can be found with the following formula 
$$ T = RC $$
Where;
- T = Time constant
- R = Resistance
- C = Capacitance
 
Confirm the capacitance via the capacitance measurement feature -|(- of my DMM.

## Uses
- Power factor correction
- Smoothing current peaks/troughs

## Analogy
A capacitor behaves like a water tank in a water system.
- The tanks fills up while the water flows.
- When the water is turned off the tank empties into the system, continuing to provide wwater.

In a circuit, the capacitor behaves like a car park.
When current is flowing, electrons are depositted on the negative side of the capacitor and electrons flow out of the positive side.
When the current is turned off, the electrons flow back out of the negative side, throught the circuit and into the positive side of the capacitor until the voltage difference is neutralised.

## Construction
Two conductive plates seperated by a dielectric insulating material (e.g. ceramic).


## Information
The might be a stripe and symbol on the negative side of the capicitor.
- There should be two number on the side of a capacitor.
    - Capacitance (usually in microfarads): Storage capacity
    - Voltage: The maximum voltage the capacitor can handle

### Dielectric: The material will polarise when in contact with an electric field.
