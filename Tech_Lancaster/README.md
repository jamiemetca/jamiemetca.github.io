## Workshop practical task
- [TL1P1](./Logbook.md)
    - Task 1 DONE
        - Be able to identify all of the components
            - Can information be gleaned from type numbers?
        - How does the potentiometer work?
        - How are the four pins on the switch connected?
        - State the differences between transistors and MOSFET
    - Task 2
        - Identify all SMD (surface mounted devices) on both sides of the Arduino
        - Identify any through hole components? (Are there any)
    - Task 3
        - Build an LED power indicator circuit
        - Add another LED in parallel
            - Ensure the correct resistors are being used
    - Task 4
        - Measure voltages across the LEDs and resistors
            - Do the component voltages sum to the power supply voltage?
    - Task 5
        - Calculate current (I)
            - $$ I= {V_R /over R_R}$$
            - Where V_R = Voltage of resistor
            - Where R_R = Resistance of resistor
    - Task 6
    - Task 7
    - Task 8
