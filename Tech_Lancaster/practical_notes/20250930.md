# Week three 30/09/2025 - Overview of components

Weeks one and two were meet and greet and had no lab work.

- Find a web based circuit simulator.
    - everycircuit
        - Looks really good but requires payment for any circuits that are not really basic (e.g. 1 LED, 1 resistor)
    - tinkerCad
        - Not as clean as every circuit but so far has remained free.

## Be able to identify all of the components
- 4093 IC

- [MOSFET (N channel)](../Electronics/Components/Mosfet)
- [Potentiometer](../Electronics/Components/Potentiometer)

## Build an LED power indicator circuit

## Add another LED in parallel

## Ensure the correct resistors are being used
I found the voltage drop of an LED was around 1.8V and 2.2V for a red and green LED respectively.

$$ Red LED: {9V - 1.8V \over 0.02A} = {7.2V \over 0.02A} = {360Ω} $$
$$ Green LED: {9V - 2.2V \over 0.02A} = {6.8v \over 0.02A} = {340Ω} $$

We were advised to use the next step up in available resistors. Which in our kit is 470Ω.

## Measure voltages across the LEDs and resistors

The component voltages are;
- Battery: 9.27V
- Green LED: 2.16V
- Resistor (of the green LED): 6.69V
- Green branch total: 2.16V + 6.69V = 8.87V
- Red LED: 1.98V
- Resistor (of the red LED): 6.95V
- Red branch total: 1.98V + 6.95V = 8.93V

I'm missing about 0.74V but this could be for any number of reasons.

$$ (9.27V - 8.87V) + (9.27V - 8.93V) = .4V + .34V = 0.74V $$

## Calculate current (I) with 470 and 1000 ohm resistors.

$$ I= {V_R /over R_R}$$

- Where V_R = Voltage of resistor
- Where R_R = Resistance of resistor

## Measure the current with the DMM on the 200mA range.

$$ {V_R /over R_R} = { 6.69V /over 470Ω } = 0.01423A (14.23mA) $$

The measured value of 14.58mA (milli amps) is almost exactly what I expected.

The supplied 1kΩ resistor is actullay 330Ω so I'll calculate two 470Ω resistors in series.

$$ {V_R /over R_R} = { 7.13V /over 470Ω /times 2 } = {7.13V /over 940Ω} = 0.0076A (7.6mA)  $$

The measured value of 7.64mA is almost exactly as expected.

## Replace the resistor with the LDR and measure the resistance under a range of light levels

### No light (covered sensor)
$$ { V /over I } = { 7.45V /over 0.00036A } = 20,694Ω $$

### Ambient light
$$ { V /over I } = { 7.35V /over .00144A } = 5,104Ω $$

### No light (covered sensor)
$$ { V /over I } = { 7.21V /over .0062A } = 1,163Ω $$

## Additional tasks
Confirm the resistor ratings are correct.

Only one set of resistors where labelled correctly.
