# RAM - SRAM vs DRAM

## RAM - Random access memory
- Memory which is directly accessible by the cpu.
- Stores temporary data (lost when power is removed)

## SRAM - Static ram 
- Data is stored in transistors in the form of voltage.
- Requires constant power
- Requires less power than DRAM
- Faster
- More expensive to manufacture
- Less capacity
- Used as cache memeory

## DRAM - Dynamic ram
- Data is stored in capacitors in the form of electric charges
- Gradually discharge energy (requires periodic refresh)
- Slower
- Less expensive
- Used as main memory in computer systems
