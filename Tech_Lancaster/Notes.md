# Notes

## 121 call with Robbie 13/10/2025
Discussed:
- My aim: working towards a embedded software engineer role
- My restrictions: Childcare, industries I'm happy to work in

I asked:
- What is the difference in subject matter between level 3 and level 5.
- What is the aim of the course, is it to modify what is covered so I can achieve my aim (embedded software engineer.
- How often are 121's? = Every 4 weeks, but can be more often if requested.
- Is the final week practical applicable/beneficial for me?
    - I don't expect to have to solder as an embedded engineer.

Outcome:
- I requested a chat with Joe (practical demostrator)
    - I was advised he would be able to answer most of the above questions.
- Robbie mentioned an embedded software engineer that had been sent to them recently.
    - Chip-tech - Advertised a roled for Embedded software engineer.
    - Salary- 50k-60k

### Chiptech embedded software engineer role requirements:
#### Key responsibilities
- Design, implement, and maintain embedded software for STM32 microcontroller-based systems / products.
- Develop applications using STM32CubeIDE, HAL, LL, low-level register programming, and bare-metal programming without an operating system.
- Work with RTOS (e.g. ThreadX or FreeRTOS, or similar) to implement multi-threaded, real-time applications.
- Interface with hardware peripherals for example UART, SPI, I2C, GPIO, ADC/DAC, timers, DMA and PWM.
- Debug complex firmware issues using logic analysers, oscilloscopes, and JTAG/SWD debuggers.
- Optimize code for performance, memory usage, and power efficiency.
- Collaborate with hardware engineers to define requirements, select components, and validate prototypes.
- Write and maintain clear technical documentation, including software design specifications and test procedures.
- Implement software updates, bug fixes, and maintenance of legacy embedded systems.
- Support integration with higher-level systems and communication protocols (SIP, UDP, TCP, TLS and SRTP etc.).

#### Required Skills & Qualifications

- Bachelorâ€™s degree in computer engineering, Electronics, Embedded Systems, or related subject or can demonstrate years of equivalent embedded programming experience in a full-time role.
- Strong experience /skills in C/C++ for embedded systems.
- Hands-on experience with STM32 microcontrollers and development environments (preferably STM32CubeIDE or Keil, IAR, or similar).
- Solid understanding of RTOS concepts, task scheduling, inter-task communication, interrupt handling and synchronization.
- Experience with peripheral interfaces such as UART, SPI, I2C, CAN, DMA, ADC/DAC, timers, GPIO.
- Familiarity with how to work within a version control system (Git / SVN hosted using Github, etc.) and software development workflows.
- Experience with debugging tools, oscilloscopes, and logic analysers.

#### Preferred Experience

- Knowledge of using communication protocols (e.g. TCP/IP) and hardware interfaces Ethernet, WiFi, BLE, SRD.
- Experience in developing firmware for IoT, security / alarm systems.
- Knowledge of low-power embedded design and battery-operated systems.
- Familiarity with unit testing frameworks for embedded systems.
- Basic understanding of safety or regulatory requirements for electronics (e.g., CE, FCC, UL).
- Experience in developing firmware to interface with cellular modules / GPS module and a knowledge of cellular operation would be an advantage

## 121 chat with Joe 14/10/2025
### Questions for Joe
- What are the differences between course material for level 3 and level 5?
- How flexible is the course to help achieve my desired position?
- What skills do I need to demostrate by December to secure my desired role?


## Plan
- Update CV to be electronics focused
    - Focus on my journey, ability and desire to learn new skills
- Hunt for job opportunities
    - Chiptech
        - Embedded software developer
    - Milliamp
        - Junior Embedded Design Engineer
        - Junior Embedded Electronics Technician
- Reach out to companies
    - Send my CV
    - My plan, my aim, is there anything they have that
