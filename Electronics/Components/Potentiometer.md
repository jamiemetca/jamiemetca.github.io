# Potentiometer

The potentiometer is made up of two tracks
An outer track connecting the outer pins.
And an inner track connecting the inner pin to the outer track.


A potentiometer can be used as a;
## Voltage divider
Connecting the battery to the outer pins creates a voltage drop across the potentiometer.
Using the middle pin a fraction of the voltage can be chosen and sent across another component.

## Current divider (Rheostat)
A device used for current control is called a rheostat.
Potentiometers only have a small power rating so larger current circuits require a purpose made rheostats to handle the larger loads.
