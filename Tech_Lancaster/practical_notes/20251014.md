## What is a 555 Timer IC? 
The 555 timer can produce precise timing pulses or oscillations.
It can be programed to tick at different speeds or for different durations.

### Key Features & Applications 
The 555 timer operates in three main modes:
- Astable Mode
    - Acts as a free-running oscillator, continuously producing a rectangular output signal (pulses) without any external trigger.
    - This is perfect for creating flashing LEDs, buzzers, or clock signals for other circuits.
- Monostable Mode
    - Generates a single pulse of a specific duration when triggered by an external event.
    - This is useful for things like debouncing switches or creating time-delay circuits.
- Bistable Mode
    - Acts like a flip-flop, with two stable states (high or low output) that can be toggled by different input pins.
    - This can be used for simple latching switches.

### Pin description
- Pin 1 (Ground)
    - Connects to the negative terminal/ground
- Pin 2 (Trigger)
    - When this pin goes low (less than $ 1\over3 $ of [VCC](/Electronics/Acronyms)), the output goes high.
    - It's $ 1\over3 $ because the voltage divider (three resistors) drop the voltage by $ 1\over3 $ after each transistor.
- Pin 3 (Output)
    - The output voltage from the chip is;
        - around 1.5 V lower than VCC when high
        - around 0 V when low.
    - A 555 timer can give out only 100 to 200 mA in total.
- Pin 4 (Reset)
    - This pin resets the whole circuit.
    - It’s an “inverted” pin, which means it resets when the pin goes low.
    - The pin must be high normally so that the chip isn’t in a “reset” state.
- Pin 5 (Control Voltage)
    - This pin is used to control the threshold voltage of the Threshold pin.
    - This can be useful when you want to adjust the frequency of the circuit without changing the values of R1, R2, and C1.
    - Sometimes a capacitor is connected (0.01 µF/10 nF) to ground;
        - this is a way to keep any noise on it from influencing the frequency.
        - This is also a debugging action for circuit issues
- Pin 6 (Threshold)
     - This pin sets the output back to low when the voltage goes high
        - above two-thirds of VCC
- Pin 7 (Discharge)
    - This pin is unconnected when output is high
    - And connected to ground when output is low.
- Pin 8 (VCC Supply)
    - This is the positive power supply pin (takes a voltage between 5 and 15V)

## Components

<img src="/Images/555_schematic.png" width="100%" >
- There are three 5kΩ resistors between Vcc and ground.
- There are two comparators branchings off from between these resistors.
    - If + > - output is HIGH. Else it's LOW
    - Two orange triangles
    - Labelled 1 and 2
- Green box is a flip-flop (as labelled)

## How does a 555 timer work

It uses 3 5kΩ resistors to divide the supply voltage in three.
Two comparators compare thiese voltages to the input and set the flip flop
