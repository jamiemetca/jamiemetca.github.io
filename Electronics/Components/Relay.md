# Relays

Relays allow a smaller circuit (primary circuit) to control a larger circuit (secondary circuit).

The difference in the current of these two circuits is called the gain.

A traditional relay works with an electromagnet. Turning the magnet on opens/closes the secondary circuit.

A double throw relay uses a switch between two connections. As one connection is closed the other is opened.
e.g. a circuit with a light on or fan on. The light turns off when the fan is turned on and vice versa.

A double pole relay allows for two secondary circuits to be controlled by one primary circuit.
