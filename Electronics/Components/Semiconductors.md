# Semiconductors

[Back](../README.md)

A semiconductor is a material, most commonly silicon, with an electrical conductivity between that of a conductor and an insulator.

By adding impurities (dopants) or applying external energy like heat or light, its conductivity can be precisely controlled. This ability to switch between conducting and insulating states makes semiconductors essential for creating transistors, diodes, and complex integrated circuits (microchips), which form the foundation of virtually all modern electronic devices. 



N-Type
Extra electrons

P-Type
Fewer electrons


At the boundary between semiconductor types, a gap (holes) is formed which prevents the flow of electricity.
The properties of the material can be modified, e.g. in a photoresistor, photons give electrons in the P-type material enough energy to move across the gap.
This pulls electrons across, causing a current to flow.
