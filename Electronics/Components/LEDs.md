# LEDs

An LED is a type of [diode](Diodes.md) which means;
- The current can only flow in one direction

A diode is a [semiconductor](Semiconductors.md) which means;
- It's conductivity affected. In LEDs this manifests as a minimun voltage ([forward voltage](../Electrical_principles/Forward_voltage.md)) which is required to overcome it's internal bias and allow current to flow. Below this thresold, the LED is effectively turned off.
- Once the voltage level satifies the forward voltage, the LED becomes "forward biased".

All of this means LEDs doesn't have a fixed resistance and will behave differently depending on the situation.
