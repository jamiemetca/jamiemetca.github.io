[Back](../README.md)

## Objective:
- To calculate the resistor value required to prevent damage to an [LED](../Components/LEDs.md)
- To draw a circuit schematic
- To construct a circuit
- To create notes on;
  - Voltage
  - Current
  - Resistance
  - LEDs
  - Batteries
  - Resistors
- To measure several parameters
  - Voltage
    - Across the battery
    - Across the LED
    - Across the resistor
    - Across differnt parts of the circuit
  - Current (amps)
    - Coming from the battery
    - At different parts of the circuit
  - Resistance (ohms)
    - Of the LED
    - Of the resistor
- To gain real world experience constructing and testing circuits.

## Design & Components
### Circuit Description:

A breadboard with a 9v battery connected via a battery clip. With 1 LED and resistor in series. All connected via jumper wires

### Schematic: TODO

- Bill of Materials (BOM):
  - Components
