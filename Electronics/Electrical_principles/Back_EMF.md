# Counter EMF (Back EMF)

Is the the electromotive force manifesting as a voltage which opposed the change in current which induced it.

From what I've read, it seems to affect moving circuits, i.e. motors. But I might be wrong in that understanding.

An electromagnet in a circuit stores charge in it's magnetic field. When the circuit is turned off, the magnet discharges very quickly, powering the circuit after the power is removed.

This can damage components, and so a diode can be used to prevent current travelling in the wrong direction or reaching components.
