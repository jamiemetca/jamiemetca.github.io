# Taking measurements

Notes on measuring circuit properites.

## Measuring voltage with a multimeter
Voltage must be measured in parallel to component.
This means voltage can be measured with the component still in the circuit.

On the multimeter, select the appropriate voltage setting.
- V~ is for AC circuits.
- VâŽ“ is for DC circuits.

Select the voltage range you expect to measure.
e.g. if unsure, start at the highest voltage and work down until you get a reading.

## Measuring current with a multimeter
Current must be measured in series. This means the circuit must be modified to allow the multimeter to be in series with the component being measured.

## Measuring resistance
Component resistance must be measured in isolation.
This requires the componenets to be removed from the circuit to allow measurements.
