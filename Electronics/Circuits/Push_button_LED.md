# Push button LED circuit
An example circuit provided by Arduino. Pressing a button turns on/off and LED

## Circuit overview
For this circuit we use two pins on the arduino.
- 13 as an output pin for the LED
- 2 as an input pin to detect the button press

Pin 13 is set to replicate the state of pin 2.
When pin two goes high, pin 13 is set to high.

## Circuit

Pin 2 is connected to ground via the button and the 10kÎ© resistor.

This default connection pulls the pin down to ground. If it's removed the LED
behaves in an unpredictable manner, sometimes it detects a high voltage and
sometimes it detects a low voltage.

When the button is pressed, pin 2 in connected to live (high, power).
When this happens the code causes pin 13 to go high, which turns on the LED.


A simplified example of arduinos button example
```c
const int buttonPin = 2;
const int ledPin = 13;

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  int buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

  digitalWrite(ledPin, buttonState);
}

```
