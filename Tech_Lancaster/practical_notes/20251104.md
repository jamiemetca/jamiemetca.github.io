## Logic gates
Working with digital signals (high, low, 1, 0) we can constuct truth tables.
Those tables can be constructed using logic gates.

### Buffer or relay
This is the simplest gate. The input matches the output.

|----|---|
| In | Q |
|----|---|
| 0  | 0 |
| 1  | 1 |
|----|---|

### Not gate or inverter
When the input is hight the output is low, and vice versa

|----|---|
| In | Q |
|----|---|
| 0  | 1 |
| 1  | 0 |
|----|---|

### And gate
There are two inputs. The output is only high when both inputs are high.

|---|---|---|
| A | B | Q |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
|---|---|---|

### Or gate
There are two inputs. The output is high if either of the inputs are high.

|---|---|---|
| A | B | Q |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
|---|---|---|

### Nand gate
A nand gate is the oppposite to an and gate not + and = nand.
The output is only low if both inputs are high.

|---|---|---|
| A | B | Q |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |
|---|---|---|

The nand gates can be used to produce all other gates. Nand gates can then be
used to reduce construction complexity and costs of boards.

This point is made cleary via [Nand to tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org). An
online source with the aim of highlighting how a working computer can be
produced using only nand gates. The [nand game](https://www.nandgame.com/) is
another great, related resource.

The 4093 is a chip containing 4 nand gates. The nand gates on this chip have
the added benefit of having [Schmitt trigger](/Electronics/Components/Schmitt_trigger)
nand gates.

This is the same circuit setup as above, using nand gates on the 4093.

And here is the real world implementation.

## Tasks
Build the logic gates with the 4000 series chip provided (4093)

Build the skip circuit

Build a circuit that requires a button to be pressed to before flashing.

Review notes for all previous practicals

We were shown a latch. Build it.
