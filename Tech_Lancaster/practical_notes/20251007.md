# Week four 07/10/2025 - Capacitors and auto night light

- Frequency calculation
    - 1 second/ time (time for 1 wave cycle)  = frequency
- PicoScope
- 230V * 1.4(RMS value) = 320V
- half-wave rectifier- AC -> DC
- Diode
    - current goes towards the silver stripe
    - Voltage drop
        - 0.71 - This number comes up alot
        - The voltage lost across a diode
        - It's a side-effect
        - P-N junction - this drop is what consumes the power.
- On Amazone (Ali-express ~ £3)
    - buy a kit to build your own signal generator
    - requires soldering
- Capacitors
    - T = RC
        - Add time to discharge calculation to formula page.
    - Capacitance is how much charge is stored per volt.
    - What is meant by a polarised capacitor?
        - This means it can only be connected in one direction.
        - What happens if it's connected the wrong way and why?
    - Ripple voltage
        - The capacitor can't charge quickly enough.
        - This occurs when the power is drawn quickly enough between phases that the capacitor begins to discharge.
    - Shark fin graph
        - Multiple the time factor by 5 to get an idea of how long a capacitor will take to discharge.
            - Will it take the same amout of time to charge?
    - They are timing circuits
        - Toasters
        - Bathroom fans
        - Car interior lights
- Voltage
    - What is considered low?
    - Does it depend on the current?
    - Can you SAFELY measure the resistance of you (the capacitor was discharging through his body)
-  R-C network
    - r= r per v
    - c = c per volt
    - T = RC
- Transistor
    - Why does the resistor on the base affect the brighnes of the LED
- MOSFET
    - The base is activated by voltage. No current needs to flow.
    - They are also sensitive, and so can be damaged by static electricity.
        - Be sure to use the ESD strap before handling.

- TODO
    - Review the tasks
    - Write ups;
        - Circuits covered
            - Create schematics for all the circuits built.
            - Upload images and video
        - Components covered
            - Update existing notes with additional notes
            - Create notes for new components
    - Investigate the dimming circuit further.
        - What affect does changing each of the resistors have?

# Charge and capacitor (22uF)
- Measure the voltage
- Observe discharging
- Comment on time taken to discharge

Notes on capacitors [here](/Electronics/Components/Capacitors)

$$ T = RC $$
Where;
- T = Time constant
- R = Resistance
- C = Capacitance
 
I measured the following.
- The capacitor has 23.2μF.
- The resistance was 23.54kΩ.
Convert to base units.
$$ 23.2μF = 23.2 \times 10^{-6} = 0.0000232F $$
$$ 23.54kΩ = 23.54 \times 10^{3} = 23,540Ω $$
$$ T = R \times C = 23,540Ω \times 0.0000232F = 0.546 seconds $$

Following the time constant table I'd expect 36.8% of max voltage after 0.546 seconds. (3.24V)

This is not what I saw: It took 4 minutes and 21 seconds (261 seconds) to go from 9V to 3.24V (~36% of max).

My error: I was measuring the discharge with the DMM in series which significantly increased the resistance of the circuit.

I modified the circuit to measure the voltage in parallel and the discharge time dropped.
After approximately 1 second, which is approximately 2 time constanct units, the voltage was about 1.2V which is very close to the expected 1.24V (2T = 13.5%)

# Build and assess the Automatic night light circuit
- Meaure the gain (hFE) of the transistor.


- Measure the voltages in the circuit
    - Transistor base voltage (between base and 0V) when on and off
    - Transistor collector voltage (between collector and 0V) when on and off
    - LED voltage when on and off
    - Any other voltages to check
