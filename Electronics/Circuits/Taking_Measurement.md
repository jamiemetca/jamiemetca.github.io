# Taking measurements

Notes on measuring circuit properites.

## Measuring voltage across components.
Voltage must be measured in parallel to component.

On the multimeter, select the appropriate voltage setting.
- V~ is for AC circuits.
- VâŽ“ is for DC circuits.

Select the voltage range you expect to measure.
e.g. if unsure, start at the highest voltage and work down until you get a reading.
