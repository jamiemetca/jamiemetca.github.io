## Logic gates
Working with digital signals (high, low, 1, 0) we can constuct truth tables.
Those tables can be constructed using logic gates.

### Buffer or relay
This is the simplest gate. The input matches the output.

|----|---|
| In | Q |
|----|---|
| 0  | 0 |
| 1  | 1 |
|----|---|

### Not gate or inverter
When the input is hight the output is low, and vice versa

|----|---|
| In | Q |
|----|---|
| 0  | 1 |
| 1  | 0 |
|----|---|

### And gate
There are two inputs. The output is only high when both inputs are high.

|---|---|---|
| A | B | Q |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
|---|---|---|

### Or gate
There are two inputs. The output is high if either of the inputs are high.

|---|---|---|
| A | B | Q |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
|---|---|---|

### Nand gate
A nand gate is the oppposite to an and gate not + and = nand.
The output is only low if both inputs are high.

|---|---|---|
| A | B | Q |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |
|---|---|---|

## Tasks
Build the logic gates with the 4000 series chip provided (4093)

Build the skip circuit

Build a circuit that requires a button to be pressed to before flashing.

Review notes for all previous practicals

We were shown a latch. Build it.
