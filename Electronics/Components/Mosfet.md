# MOSFET (Metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect)

A MOSFET is a type of transistor (FET - Field effect transistor), it differs from other transistors because it's;
- Voltage controlled
- Uses a single type of charge carrier (electron or hole)

The MOSFET is more efficient for high-power, high-current and digital circuit applications as they consume very little input power to maintain their state.
