# Simple LED

[Back](../README.md]

 * Date:20/09/2025
 * Objective: This simple circuit will provide a hands on project with which to learn and better understand voltage, current and basic components (batteries, LEDs and resistors)

## Design & Components
 * Circuit Description: The circuit will consist of a breadboard, a single 9v battery, an LED, a resistor and some wires. The 9v battery will provide the power, which will need to be reduced via a resistor, so as not to burn out the LED. 
 * Schematic: TODO
 * Bill of Materials (BOM):
   * Component:* Value/Spec: * Quantity: * Datasheet Link (Optional): ---
