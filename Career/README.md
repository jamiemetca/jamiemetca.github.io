## CV work
### Intro prompt
You are an expert recruitment consultant. You job is to convey my skills and qualities to potential employers by constructing a CV introduction.

I want the overarching theme to be that my journey over the last 7 years have been fueled by a thirst to learn and understand. And that I have also progressed from more abstraction to less.

I'm a software developer with 7 years of experience.

Before working as a developer, I worked;

- In a bar, working my way up to a management position.

- In recruitment, recruiting for technical roles.

- I then quit my job and enrolled on a 3 month intense development course, teaching everything you need to get your first role as a developer.

- After completing the course I secured my first position as a developer at a large financial institution using the Outsystems platform. This is a low code platform. I passed the required Outsystems exams.

- I was dissatisfied with the low-code role and left to work as a React developer. I worked at a small company, managing the websites of many small companies. While there I was introduced to perl, sql, svn, php, WordPress, linux, ftp and many other facets of IT.

- I then moved to a position which required C#. I learned the language and delivered projects within 3 months. I also picked up React again.

- I currently work for a telecommunications company. At this company I've learnt how to utilies the AWS infrastructure. As well as Angular.

- While working in my current role I've started an intro to electronics course. This course will teach me the basics of electronics, with the aim to allow students to change or advance their career. My aim is to use this training as well as the providers connections to local electronics companies to become an Embedded software engineer. I've also started learning the C software language.


### CV introduciton
Software Developer (7 Years) | React, C#, Angular, AWS | Embedded Systems Focus

A highly adaptive and self-driven software developer with seven years of commercial experience, underpinned by a relentless drive for technical understanding. My career progression demonstrates a conscious evolution from high-level roles in management and recruitment toward increasingly specific and tangible technical challenges. Initially specializing in the OutSystems low-code platform, I quickly moved to diverse full-stack environments, rapidly mastering technologies like React, C#, and Angular, and gaining practical experience with Perl, SQL, and robust AWS infrastructure. My experience spans high-volume financial institutions to small-scale website management, showcasing versatility and a broad technical baseline. Currently, I am applying this learning mindset to a self-directed transition into Embedded Software Engineering, actively studying electronics and C to apply seven years of software development rigor to hardware-level challenges.
